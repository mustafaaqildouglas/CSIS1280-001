        <p>AirPods are wireless Bluetooth earbuds designed by Apple Inc. They were first announced on September 7, 2016 alongside the iPhone 7. Within two years, they became Apple's most popular accessory. They are Apple's entry-level wireless headphones, sold alongside the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. 
          In addition to playing audio, the AirPods contain a microphone that filters out background noise as well as built-in accelerometers and optical sensors capable of detecting taps and pinches (e.g. double-tap or pinch to pause audio) and placement within the ear, which enables automatic pausing of audio when they are taken out.
          Airpods being the most popular earphones sold in the world, lead Apple's business after the iPhone, It might be strange to comprehend that an accessory is leading over Apple Macintosh and the iPad, but indeed it is. The lineup for 2021-2022 consists of Airpods 2, Airpods 3, Airpods Pro and the Airpods Max.
